Setting Up a Reproducible R Analysis Environment
This repository provides a framework for setting up a robust and reproducible R analysis environment. It focuses on project organization, package management, and best practices to ensure your R projects are well-structured, portable, and easy to share.

Key Features
Project Structure: A clear and organized project structure using the here package for relative file paths. This makes your project portable and avoids hardcoded paths.
Package Management: Efficient package management with the pacman package. Install packages with p_install() and load them with p_load().
Global Parameters: Centralized global parameters and API keys in a dedicated script. API keys are securely stored as environment variables.
Reproducibility: Emphasis on reproducibility with a set random seed and clear documentation.
Package Conflicts: Resolve function name conflicts using conflicts_prefer().
Organized Scripts: Well-commented and organized R scripts (e.g., packages.R, global_parameters.R).
Project Organization
The recommended project structure is as follows:

├── 01_load.R
├── 02_clean.R
├── 03_model.R
├── 04_output.R
├── packages.R
├── global_parameters.R
├── _archive
│   └── _anchor.R
└── _images
    └── anchor_R.png

_archive/_anchor.R: This file serves as the anchor for the here package, defining the root of your project.
packages.R: This script manages the installation and loading of all required R packages for your project.
global_parameters.R: This script stores global settings, API keys (as environment variables), and resolves package conflicts.
01_load.R: This script is for loading in necessary files.
02_clean.R: This script is for data cleaning.
03_model.R: This script is for running models.
04_output.R: This script is for creating output.
_images: This folder is for storing images.
How to Use
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Set up environment variables: Create environment variables for your API keys (e.g., ELSEVIER_API_KEY, CENSUS_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY).
Install packages: Run the packages.R script to install and load the necessary packages.
Configure global parameters: Review and modify the global_parameters.R script to match your project settings.
Start your analysis: Begin your R analysis, using the provided scripts and folder structure as a foundation.
Best Practices
Use relative file paths: Always use the here() function to construct file paths.
Organize your scripts: Break down your analysis into smaller, well-defined scripts.
Document your code: Use comments to explain your code and its purpose.
Set a random seed: Use set.seed() for reproducibility.
Manage package conflicts: Use conflicts_prefer() to resolve conflicts.
